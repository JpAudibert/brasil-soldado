# BRASIL! SOLDADO

This system is Java based and its purpose is to solve some problems that I've found
while I was trying to not be selected by the brasilian army (ahah, funny joke tho).
Brasil! Soldado is part of the Application Programming discipline, from my college,
Univates, from Lajeado, Rio Grande do Sul, Brasil. The name was selected after I've
listened a soldier saying this phrase while I was visiting the installations.

Thank you for your attention! Enjoy!
